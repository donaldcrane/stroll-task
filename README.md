# Stroll Task

## Overview

This project sets up several key components, including user, cycle, region, question, and assignedQuestion tables. The core functionality revolves around managing cycles (representing weeks) and assigning questions to users in specific regions.

## Key Features

-   **User, Cycle, Region, Question, and AssignedQuestion Models**:

    -   The cycle table stores different weeks, which are created by the admin.
    -   Each user is assigned a question based on their region.

-   **CRUD Operations**:

    -   Full CRUD operations have been implemented for all the models.

-   **Automated Question Assignment**:
    -   A cron job runs every 7 days (once a week) to automatically assign questions to users.
    -   A queue system ensures that questions are distributed efficiently among users in each region.
